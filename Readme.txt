The script is intended for use with a free DDoS service, which doesn’t have CAPTCHA and can effectively perform DDoS attacks.

To use the "authorization": "Bearer REPLACE WITH KEY TO TOPSTRESSER" section, you’ll need to create an account and obtain an account key. The service is free and can DDoS well.

This script was primarily designed to target and take down https://byteus.org.
